# ADR 0001: Project scope and documentation

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-08-29

## Context
We need a small public project to showcase QA + DevOps skills with full documentation.

## Decision
- Project name: `qa-lab-bank`.
- Keep *all* docs in the repo under `docs/` in Markdown.
- Use a journal (`docs/journal.md`) to log steps.
- Use ADRs for significant choices.

## Consequences
- Everything is versioned and portable.
- Easy to present later (can copy notes into slides).
